# Capstone Travel App

## Project Overview
This project aims to give you the opportunity to use all of the skills you have learned during the Udacity FEND course, into one project to build your own capstone travel app. It uses JavaScript heavily, but still the project is expected to be created in clean and appealing HTML/CSS. You will also be targeting the DOM, working with objects, and retrieving data from 3 APIs in which one of those is reliant on another to work. Finally, this is all going to be done in a Webpack environment, using an express server, and wrapped up with service workers.

For this project, refactor and test as much as possible while you are building. You should figure for every piece of functionality you add, you will likely spend just as much time testing and refactoring your code. If it takes you 5 hours to figure out the logic, it should likely take you another 5 hours determining that you wrote the best code possible. As your skills improve, this process will feel more natural. Make sure to remove any debugging code from your final submission.

The minimum requirements ask a fair amount from you, but the final app is quite simple. A roadmap to expand on the application and make it uniquely your own is provided.
